## ‚úÖ **Task Statement 1.2: Identify Practical Use Cases for AI**

---

### üîπ 1. **Recognize Applications Where AI/ML Can Provide Value**

AI/ML provides value in situations where:

* **Patterns in large datasets** can be learned and used to make predictions or automate tasks.
* **Scalability** is needed beyond human capability (e.g., analyzing millions of emails or images).
* **Decision support** is required (e.g., risk scoring, recommendation engines).
* **Automation** of repetitive or manual tasks is desirable (e.g., chatbots, document classification).

| **Use Case**              | **AI/ML Value**                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer churn prediction | Assist human decision making (identify at-risk customers) |
| Image classification      | Automate visual tasks                                     |
| Chatbots                  | Scale customer support without additional staff           |
| Fraud detection           | Continuously learn and flag suspicious behavior           |

### üîπ 2. **Determine When AI/ML Solutions Are Not Appropriate**

AI/ML may not be suitable when:

* **Deterministic logic is sufficient** (e.g., rule-based validation like ZIP code formatting).
* **A specific or guaranteed outcome is needed** rather than a probabilistic prediction (e.g., legal decisions, critical medical diagnosis without oversight).
* **Training data is insufficient or of poor quality**, leading to unreliable results.
* **Costs outweigh the benefits**, especially if simpler automation is available.

| **Consideration** | **Why AI/ML May Not Be Ideal**                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clear rules exist | Easier and cheaper to implement with standard programming |
| No training data  | ML cannot learn without data                              |
| High risk of bias | AI may inherit or amplify bias from training data         |
| Limited budget    | AI/ML can be expensive to develop and maintain            |

### üîπ 3. **Select the Appropriate ML Techniques for Specific Use Cases**

| **ML Technique**            | **Use Case**                                 | **Description**                       |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Regression**              | Predicting housing prices, sales forecasting | Predicts a continuous numerical value |
| **Classification**          | Email spam detection, disease diagnosis      | Predicts a category or class label    |
| **Clustering**              | Customer segmentation, product grouping      | Finds groups in data without labels   |
| **Time-series forecasting** | Stock prices, energy demand                  | Predicts future values over time      |
| **Recommendation Systems**  | Netflix, Amazon suggestions                  | Suggests items based on user behavior |
| **Anomaly Detection**       | Fraud detection, equipment failure           | Identifies unusual patterns           |

### üîπ 4. **Identify Examples of Real-World AI Applications**

| **Domain**           | **AI Application**                | **Tech Used**                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Retail**           | Product recommendation            | Collaborative filtering           |
| **Healthcare**       | Medical image diagnosis           | Computer vision                   |
| **Finance**          | Fraud detection                   | Anomaly detection                 |
| **Customer Service** | Chatbots                          | NLP (Natural Language Processing) |
| **Marketing**        | Sentiment analysis on reviews     | NLP                               |
| **Manufacturing**    | Predictive maintenance            | Time-series analysis              |
| **Entertainment**    | Content personalization           | Recommendation systems            |
| **Voice Assistants** | Speech-to-text and text-to-speech | Speech recognition & synthesis    |

### üîπ 5. **Explain the Capabilities of AWS Managed AI/ML Services**

These services allow developers to implement AI/ML without deep data science knowledge.

| **Service**           | **Category**                | **Functionality**                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Amazon SageMaker**  | ML Platform                 | Build, train, and deploy ML models at scale. Offers built-in algorithms, notebooks, and model hosting. |
| **Amazon Transcribe** | Speech Recognition          | Converts speech into text (e.g., call center transcripts, voice apps).                                 |
| **Amazon Translate**  | Machine Translation         | Translates text between languages in real time.                                                        |
| **Amazon Comprehend** | Natural Language Processing | Extracts insights (sentiment, key phrases, entities) from text.                                        |
| **Amazon Lex**        | Conversational Interfaces   | Builds chatbots and voice assistants with automatic speech recognition and NLP.                        |
| **Amazon Polly**      | Text-to-Speech              | Converts text into realistic speech in various languages.                                              |

‚úÖ **AWS AI services** are **fully managed**, meaning AWS handles infrastructure, scaling, and most of the model complexity, enabling faster deployment and easier integration.

## üìù Study Tips

* **Use Cases Drill**: Go through different industries and brainstorm how AI might help (e.g., AI in logistics = route optimization).
* **Service Matching**: Match AWS services to real-world needs (e.g., Amazon Comprehend = understanding customer feedback).
* **Practice Questions**: Focus on scenario-based questions that ask you to choose when AI is or isn‚Äôt a good solution.
* **Hands-On (Optional but Valuable)**: Use the AWS free tier to explore SageMaker Studio Lab, Polly, or Comprehend.
