## üõ°Ô∏è 3. BENEFITS OF AWS INFRASTRUCTURE FOR GENERATIVE AI

| **Benefit**        | **How It Helps GenAI Applications**                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security**       | Integrated IAM, VPC, encryption (KMS), and compliance controls for secure deployments.                   |
| **Compliance**     | Services comply with global regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2) using AWS Artifact.                   |
| **Responsibility** | Follows AWS Shared Responsibility Model; developers retain control over data and logic.                  |
| **Safety**         | Amazon Bedrock includes content filtering, guardrails, and policies to reduce harmful or biased outputs. |
| **Availability**   | Built on AWS global infrastructure with high availability zones and regions.                             |
| **Observability**  | CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and Model Monitor help track performance and detect issues.                      |

## üí∞ 4. COST TRADE-OFFS OF AWS GENERATIVE AI SERVICES

Understanding cost factors helps align technical decisions with business goals.

| **Cost Factor**               | **Description**                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Token-Based Pricing**       | Amazon Bedrock charges based on tokens processed (input/output), not compute time.                                            |
| **Provisioned Throughput**    | SageMaker Inference or Bedrock can be configured for guaranteed throughput‚Äîhigher cost but lower latency.                     |
| **Responsiveness vs. Cost**   | Real-time inference (e.g., chatbots) costs more than batch processing or caching.                                             |
| **Custom Models**             | Training custom models on SageMaker incurs compute/storage costs. Fine-tuning or parameter-efficient tuning can reduce costs. |
| **Availability & Redundancy** | Multi-region support increases cost but improves fault tolerance and compliance.                                              |
| **Regional Coverage**         | Certain models/services may only be available in specific regions, affecting cost/performance trade-offs.                     |
| **Service Selection**         | Bedrock is generally cheaper for inference vs. training a model from scratch in SageMaker.                                    |
| **Experimentation Costs**     | Services like PartyRock are free to prototype; ideal before moving to full deployment.                                        |
