## ‚úÖ 1. ADVANTAGES OF GENERATIVE AI

Generative AI offers a range of benefits to businesses, particularly in automating, personalizing, and scaling processes.

| **Advantage**               | **Description**                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adaptability**            | FMs can be quickly adapted to multiple domains with minimal fine-tuning.           |
| **Responsiveness**          | Real-time responses in chatbots and virtual assistants enhance user engagement.    |
| **Simplicity**              | Prompt-based interfaces reduce the need for complex data pipelines or coding.      |
| **Creativity**              | Can generate novel text, designs, code, or media assets (e.g., marketing content). |
| **Scalability**             | Easily scaled to serve millions of users with consistent performance.              |
| **Efficiency**              | Automates repetitive tasks (e.g., summarizing reports, drafting emails).           |
| **Multimodal capabilities** | Models like GPT-4 or Claude 3 can handle text, images, and more.                   |
| **Personalization**         | Supports tailored user experiences based on input context or history.              |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 2. DISADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS

Understanding the risks and boundaries of GenAI ensures responsible and reliable deployment.

| **Disadvantage**     | **Description**                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hallucinations**   | Models can generate false or misleading information confidently.                      |
| **Inaccuracy**       | May produce outputs with factual or logical errors.                                   |
| **Interpretability** | Hard to understand how or why a model makes a specific prediction.                    |
| **Nondeterminism**   | Same prompt can produce different results each time due to probabilistic nature.      |
| **Bias**             | Models may reproduce societal, cultural, or data-based biases.                        |
| **Data Sensitivity** | FMs may leak information seen during training or inference if not properly governed.  |
| **Cost**             | Large models can be expensive to run at scale (especially image or video generation). |
| **Context Limits**   | Token limits can restrict long document comprehension.                                |
| **Latency**          | Complex models may have high response times without optimized infrastructure.         |

**Mitigations**:

* Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground responses.
* Apply guardrails (e.g., Amazon Bedrock Guardrails).
* Apply human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflows with Amazon A2I.

## üß† 3. MODEL SELECTION FACTORS

Choosing the right model is critical to success in solving specific business problems.

| **Factor**                   | **Explanation**                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model Type**               | Text (Claude), image (Stable Diffusion), code (CodeWhisperer), multi-modal       |
| **Capabilities**             | Does the model support summarization, question answering, etc.?                  |
| **Performance Requirements** | Does it need low latency, high throughput, or support for large context windows? |
| **Cost Constraints**         | Smaller models may suffice for simpler tasks; avoid overpaying.                  |
| **Compliance**               | Does the model/provider support required data governance or region restrictions? |
| **Tuning Options**           | Can you fine-tune the model or use parameter-efficient techniques (e.g., LoRA)?  |
| **Inference Needs**          | Does the solution require real-time, batch, or edge inference?                   |
| **Deployment Method**        | SaaS (Amazon Bedrock) vs fully managed (SageMaker) vs containerized (ECS/EKS)    |
| **Security & Privacy**       | Consider encryption, VPC support, and data isolation.                            |

**Tip**: Use **Amazon Bedrock** to experiment with multiple models behind a common API (e.g., Claude, Cohere, Titan).
