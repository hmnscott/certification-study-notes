### 6. Understand model performance metrics and business metrics to evaluate ML models

Evaluating an ML model requires looking at both its technical performance and its impact on business objectives.

#### Model Performance Metrics (Technical Metrics)

These metrics assess how well the model predicts outcomes based on the data. The choice of metric depends heavily on the type of ML problem (classification, regression, etc.).

* **For Classification Models:**
    * **Accuracy:**
        * **Definition:** The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
        * **Formula:** $(True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Instances$
        * **Use Case:** Simple and intuitive, good for balanced datasets.
        * **Limitation:** Can be misleading for imbalanced datasets (e.g., if 95% of data belongs to one class, a model predicting that class all the time will have 95% accuracy).
    * **Precision:**
        * **Definition:** Out of all instances predicted as positive, how many were actually positive.
        * **Formula:** $True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)$
        * **Use Case:** Important when the cost of False Positives is high (e.g., spam detection, medical diagnosis).
    * **Recall (Sensitivity):**
        * **Definition:** Out of all actual positive instances, how many were correctly identified by the model.
        * **Formula:** $True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)$
        * **Use Case:** Important when the cost of False Negatives is high (e.g., fraud detection, disease detection).
    * **F1 Score:**
        * **Definition:** The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. It provides a single score that balances both metrics.
        * **Formula:** $2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$
        * **Use Case:** Useful when there is an uneven class distribution and you need to balance Precision and Recall.
    * **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC):**
        * **Definition:** The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve plots the True Positive Rate (Recall) against the False Positive Rate at various threshold settings.
        * **Interpretation:** A higher AUC (closer to 1.0) indicates a better ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative classes. An AUC of 0.5 suggests random guessing.
        * **Use Case:** Robust for imbalanced datasets, provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds.

* **For Regression Models:**
    * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
    * **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. Penalizes larger errors more heavily.
    * **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Square root of MSE. Easier to interpret as it's in the same units as the target variable.
    * **R-squared ($R^2$):** Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit.

#### Business Metrics (Operational and Financial Impact)

These metrics connect the technical performance of the model to tangible business outcomes and value.

* **Cost per User / Cost per Prediction:**
    * **Definition:** The operational cost (compute, storage, data transfer, developer time) associated with serving a single user or making a single prediction.
    * **Impact:** Directly affects the profitability and scalability of the ML solution.

* **Development Costs:**
    * **Definition:** The total cost incurred during the ML model's development phase, including data collection, labeling, feature engineering, model training, and experimentation.
    * **Impact:** Influences the initial investment and ROI calculation.

* **Customer Feedback:**
    * **Definition:** Qualitative and quantitative feedback from users about their experience with the ML-powered product or feature. This can include surveys, reviews, support tickets, or direct user testing.
    * **Impact:** Essential for understanding user satisfaction and identifying areas for improvement that technical metrics might miss.

* **Return on Investment (ROI):**
    * **Definition:** A financial metric that measures the profitability of an investment in an ML solution.
    * **Formula:** $(Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment$
    * **Impact:** The ultimate measure of an ML project's success from a business perspective. Examples of gains could be increased revenue, reduced costs, improved efficiency, or enhanced customer satisfaction.

* **Other Potential Business Metrics:**
    * **Revenue Uplift:** Increase in sales directly attributable to the ML model (e.g., recommendation systems).
    * **Churn Reduction:** Decrease in customer attrition due to personalized interventions (e.g., customer retention models).
    * **Fraud Detection Rate:** Percentage of fraudulent transactions correctly identified.
    * **Operational Efficiency Gains:** Time saved, manual effort reduced due to automation by the ML model.
    * **Lead Conversion Rate:** For lead scoring models.
