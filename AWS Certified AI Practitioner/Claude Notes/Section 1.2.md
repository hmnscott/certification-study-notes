### Model Evaluation and Selection

#### Classification Metrics
**Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions
- **When to use**: Balanced datasets with equal importance for all classes
- **Formula**: (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Predictions
- **Limitations**: Can be misleading with imbalanced datasets

**Precision**: Proportion of positive predictions that are correct
- **When to use**: When false positives are costly
- **Formula**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
- **Example**: Email spam detection (minimize false spam classification)

**Recall (Sensitivity)**: Proportion of actual positives correctly identified
- **When to use**: When false negatives are costly
- **Formula**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
- **Example**: Medical diagnosis (don't miss actual diseases)

**F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **When to use**: Balance between precision and recall
- **Formula**: 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- **Example**: General classification tasks with some class imbalance

#### Regression Metrics
**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference between predictions and actual values
- **Interpretation**: Easy to understand, same units as target variable
- **Use case**: When outliers shouldn't heavily influence evaluation

**Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Square root of average squared differences
- **Interpretation**: Penalizes large errors more heavily than MAE
- **Use case**: When large errors are particularly problematic

**Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Average percentage error
- **Interpretation**: Scale-independent, easy to communicate
- **Use case**: When relative errors are more important than absolute errors

#### Cross-Validation Strategies
**K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Split data into k folds, train on k-1, test on 1
- **Advantages**: Uses all data for training and testing
- **Use case**: Standard approach for most problems

**Time Series Cross-Validation**: Respect temporal order in validation
- **Approach**: Use historical data to predict future periods
- **Use case**: Time series forecasting problems

**Stratified Cross-Validation**: Maintain class distribution across folds

## Summary

This study guide covers the practical aspects of identifying when and how to use AI/ML solutions effectively. The key to success on the AWS AI Practitioner exam is understanding not just what AI/ML can do, but when it's the right solution and how to implement it using AWS services.

**Remember the fundamental principle**: AI/ML is most valuable when you need to find patterns in large amounts of data, scale solutions beyond human capacity, or automate complex decision-making processes. However, it's not always the right answer – sometimes simple rules, deterministic algorithms, or human judgment are more appropriate.

Focus on understanding the business value of AI/ML solutions and how AWS managed services can accelerate implementation while reducing complexity and cost. Practice applying this knowledge to realistic business scenarios to prepare for the exam.
